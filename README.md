Flow reworks the container desgin on tabs to make it feel a bit more fluent.
1. #### Inactive
  ![Container Inactive](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db28b0e9-f000-473b-b6a8-50a8db9beb98)

  A small bar that is mostly faded out so you can tell what container the tab is in at a glance, but not be _too_ distracting
  
2. #### Active
  ![Container Active](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656d0595-cee0-4773-a99a-c783c27ebac0)

  The bar expands showing the container color clearly with no fade.

#### Other Features
The indicator in the URL bar was hidden as it felt inconsistent. This makes the borwser flow better.

_If you have ideas for what to add to the containers please read the feature request section._
### Restyled Context Menu
#### 1. New Colors
The context menus now use a slighty transparent black and a `#444` border as it feels more native to Zen
